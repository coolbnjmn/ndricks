We provide custom sports analytics data solutions, using the latest AI techniques and models.

Bespoke APIs for your needs can be built in just a few weeks, and you own all the data.

Reach out to benjamin@ndricks.com to discuss your business' sports data needs. 

### Background

Benjamin Hendricks recently published his master's thesis titled [Sports Analytics with Natural Language Processing: Using Crowd Sentiment to Pick Winners in Fantasy Football](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37371598) is the foundational architecture we use to create our custom APIs. By retrieving data from a variety of sources (social media APIs, scraping, etc), we then process these raw inputs with the help of AI to produce valuable, condensed data you can use.

### Use Cases

#### Fantasy Football Projections

To illustrate a specific example, let's take fantasy projections. We can provide an API that produces projections for each NFL player in a given game week, which are of higher accuracy than professional projections you can find on the web (IE from NFL.com, Yahoo, etc). We do this by aggregating projections from these sites, and combine that with sentiment data retrieved from tweets about players. The resulting projections are ~15% more accurate. 

You can learn more about this use case by watching [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFNnDBjqhz4&t=1078s) given at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in 2023.


#### SportsBooks

A theoretical other use of this technology is to help improve betting lines for sportsbooks. The more data the better, and we can provide an easy to use and reliable API to any sportsbook that wants to incorporate crowd information about a bet. This can be by pulling in Tweets, or could be from monitoring a specific website, or even a Reddit page. Any available online source of information can be analyzed for potential information about an outcome, and returned in a simple to use API.
